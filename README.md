# responsive-portfolio

This is a my responsive portfolio, I made my portfolio with a few stuff in mind, some of the stuff i tried to include are the following.

1) I included my name, my git hub avatar(instead of a photo of myself), link to my git hub and contact information, a bit about myself and a few previous project i had done.
2) When you clink on the anything in the navigation bar it will take you to the corresponding section.  
3) When you click on any of my projects it will take you to them.
4) When the page is changed in size my portfolio will adapt.
